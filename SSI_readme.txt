History:
============================================================================
    3.30.19.04
    2022-03-31
Bug Fixes
1. Removed parameter view for equations with no parameters.
Minor Improvements
1. Added options to view West Coast Rebuilder file (rebuild.dat).
2. Removed some code that was not used.
============================================================================
    3.30.19.03
    2022-02-17
Bug Fixes
1. Fixed the display of output and new file directories on Output Files tab.
2. Fixed autogenerating spline parameters.
3. Fixed initial display of spline.
Minor Improvements
1. Spline setup: Added options 10, 11, and 12 to the setup parameter. They
   are similar to 0, 1, and 2 but set selectivity to 0 for x-values less
   than the first knot.
============================================================================
   3.30.18.04
   2021-12-23
Bug Fixes
1. Fixed handling of F Method = 2. An extra value was being added causing
  the model to fail to execute.
Minor Improvements
1. Added capability for Do_Msy=5 (MEY).
2. Added switches for sso and ss_new files for saving to separate folders.
============================================================================
    3.30.18.03
    2021-11-17
Bug Fixes
1. The negative limit for early rec dev phase was set to -5, now set to -99.
   The positive limit remains at 99.
2. Fixed age selectivity retain time varying param display.
   The age selex retain tv params display was reading the number of parameters
   from size retain tv params. The data files were unaffected, but the display
   was incorrect.
============================================================================
    3.30.18.02
    2021-11-08
Minor Improvements
1. Added Cessation parameter for Growth model 8.
Bug Fixes
1. A default is set for BLimit and it only shows for Benchmarks = 3.
2. Number of platoons is forced to 1, 3, or 5 and a default is set
   for the between/within ratio.
============================================================================
    3.30.18.01
    2021-10-13
Bug Fixes
1. Fixed resetting selectivity time-varying parameters between models.
2. Increased minimum population size to 50.
3. Increased decimal places to 3 in population widget.
4. Added terminator to annual control rule buffer in writing forecast.
============================================================================
    3.30.18.0
    2021-09-28
Major Improvements
1. Added Fleet specific F mort.
2. Allowed Fleet type 4 for predators.
3. Added Benchmark option 3 and Blimit value.
4. Removed support for ss_trans.
Minor Improvements
1. Added version info to summary charts.
2. Improved look of Likelihoods dialog.
Bug Fixes
1. Fixed treatment of male/female offset selectivity parameters.
2. Fixed reading/writing of Q time-varying parameters.
